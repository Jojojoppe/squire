wait(int pid):
	When a process is killed (by exit or other way) the process structure is still linked to 
	the parent process. When wait() is execute by the parent it checks for any killed childs
	in the list and returns the return value of a (depending on wait flags such as all childs
	or a specific child) child. When a killed child has been found it removes the structure
	completely from the parents list. If no killed childs (or not the right one) has been
	found the parent goes IDLE and is woken up by ANY child which is killed or has exited.
	The parent checks again for the right child, etc...
